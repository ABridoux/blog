Hi, I am Alexis. I develop applications for Apple platforms and work at KaraFun where I have had the opportunity to work on accessibility, audio, and other topics. This blog aims to compile and share valuable tips and ideas that I believe are worth disseminating especially when I struggled to find a solution or simply adequate documentation.

For tutorials and how-tos, I maintain [MoreDocs](https://moredocs.github.io) which is less personal and where I try to be more exhaustive and detailed.
