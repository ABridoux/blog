Hi, I am Alexis. I develop applications for Apple platforms and work at KaraFun where I have had the opportunity to work on accessibility, audio, and other topics. This blog aims to compile and share valuable tips and ideas that I believe are worth disseminating especially when I struggled to find a solution or simply adequate documentation.

For tutorials and how-tos, I maintain [MoreDocs](https://moredocs.github.io) which is less personal and where I try to be more exhaustive and detailed.

If you know my blog [Woody's findings](https://www.woodys-findings.com), several of its posts will be moved here while others will be move to MoreDocs and the domain name will then be associated with this new blog hosted on GitHub Pages.
